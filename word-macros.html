                A few preliminary warnings:
                <ol>
                    <li>Don't execute code you don't understand! I'm not malicious, promise, but someone else might be. They might also do something you weren't expecting, even if not malicious!</li>
                    <li>On that note: this code toggles the setting <code>Application.AutoCorrect.ReplaceText</code> - unlike other settings, this is not specific to your current document! This applies to Word as a whole, even if you shut down Word and restart! The macro produces a popup message after running telling you the current state, hopefully minimising trouble you can cause yourself.</li>
                    <li>This is a very blunt instrument for telling Word to stop messing with your stuff.</li>
                    <li>This is intended as a global macro, but feel free to use/modify as you like (this is actively "Unlicense"-ed, using the Unlicense (release at the end of this page)</li>
                    <li>All settings are toggled at once, being set to the opposite of whatever <code>Application.AutoCorrect.ReplaceText</code> currently is set to (except the <code>NoProofing</code> setting, which is set to a sensible value - if other settings are off, <code>NoProofing</code> is on)</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            To add to word, you'll need to execute a few steps
            <ol>
                <li>Enable the Developer tab</li>
                <li>Set the "Macros in" setting to the global template "Normal.dotm"</li>
                <li>Add the new Macro by hitting Edit or Create and dropping the code in, then close the VBA editor window</li>
                <li>The Macro will now be available in the Developer > Macros menu</li>
            </ol>
